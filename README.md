## Installation

The setup and initiating of the application is done using the inline terminal. A user first has to install Node.js followed by installing Inquirer. 
## Usage

There are a series of tests that can be run to insure that the code is operating as intended. The program then needs to be started using npm start. After that the user just has to follow the prompts until finished. Then an html document will be produced.
